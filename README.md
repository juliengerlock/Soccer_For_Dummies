Soccer For Dummies: An Introspective Look into Nashville's Newest Sports Team | Julien Gerlock

Summary
In the year 2020, Nashville SC opened up shop after the city was awarded an expansion bid in 2017 from the MLS to develop a top-tier soccer club. The team's inaugural match was played in February of 2020 against our newly formed rivals Atlanta United in front of a crowd of nearly 60,000 people, becoming the highest attended soccer event in Tennessee. Expansion teams in the MLS face a plethora of challenges as they must build a team from the ground up to effectively compete against well-established clubs across North America. The overarching goal of this project is to provide an all-in-one interface for analysis and statistical insights surrounding the performance of the city's newly founded soccer club. 

Inspiration
As an avid soccer fan and sportsman alike, I was ecstatic at the news of Nashville receiving an MLS expansion team. Since then I have followed every step of the club's path and attended every home game that I could. I have played and watched soccer my whole life, but this course at NSS extended the opportunity to look at the sport from an analytical perspective. It has been a dream of mine to one day work at a position within my hometown club that I adore so greatly, so I jumped at the opportunity to do my capstone project to gather insights on the club's success and share that with my colleagues and potential employers.

Intended Audience
My intended audience for this project is people interested in learning more about Nashville Soccer Club, whether it be fans, players, club members, or officials. However, I made it a clear objective of mine in this project to convey my findings in a manner so that people who are not knowledgeable about soccer can still gain an understanding and make sense of what my project is about. I hope that I can get people interested in NSC or even soccer as a whole to extend the fanbase in hopes that my enthusiasm about the sport will be contagious.
